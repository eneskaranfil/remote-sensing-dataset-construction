my current dataset format here as follows:

{
        "id": "0",
        "image": "airport_1.jpg",
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<image>\nBriefly describe this image."
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "many planes are parked next to a long building in an airport ."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "id": "1",
        "image": "airport_1.jpg",
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<image>\nBriefly describe this image."
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "many planes are parked next to a long building in an airport ."
            }
        ]
    },

Ä± need format as:

{
        "id": "0",
        "image": "airport_1.jpg",
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<image>\nBriefly describe this image."
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "many planes are parked next to a long building in an airport ."
            },
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<image>\nBriefly describe this image."
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "many planes are parked next to a long building in an airport ."
            }, ... (can be more question)
        ]
    },

gather same image name entries in the one entry.
